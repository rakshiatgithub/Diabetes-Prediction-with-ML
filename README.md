## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a dataset containing various health-related attributes. The Random Forest Classifier is used to build the model, and the performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset, which contains the following features:
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (target variable indicating whether the person has diabetes or not, with 1 for diabetic and 0 for non-diabetic)

You can find the dataset in the `diabetes_data.csv` file.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

To install the dependencies, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
